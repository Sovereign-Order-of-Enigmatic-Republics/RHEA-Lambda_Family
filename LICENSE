## 5. Symbolic Derivative Clause

You may **not** re-encode, disguise, or re-express the core logic of the RHEA frameworks using alternate symbols, glyphs, metaphors, or language systems.

Prohibited derivative encodings include, but are not limited to:

- entropy modulation systems under alternative symbolic alphabets;
- trust resealing or trust-vector dynamics under renamed constructs;
- recursive glyph architectures expressed in alternate notation;

---

This license is enforceable under:

- U.S. Copyright Law (Title 17),
- DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act),
- U.S. Patent Law (Provisional #63/796,404),
- International copyright law and WIPO frameworks.

Violations may result in:

- formal DMCA takedown actions,
- cease-and-desist orders,
- civil damages,
- patent-related claims where applicable.

---

## 8. Revocation Triggers (Condensed Summary)

This license revokes all prior open-use permissions due to:

- government clawbacks targeting vulnerable populations,
- systemic underfunding of scientific, educational, and veteran services,
- coercive public-health mandates violating informed consent,
- institutional obstruction of RHEA-UCM peer review and attribution,
- unauthorized appropriation of RHEA-UCM concepts by public-facing figures,
- policy violations of the SOER (Standard of Ethical Recursion).

These factors necessitate full reassertion of rights and termination of all implied public licenses.

---

## 9. Academic & Private Reproduction

Permitted:

- quoting small excerpts with attribution,
- citing in research or peer-review contexts,
- private archival copies.

Not permitted:

- republication,
- redistribution,
- uploading to public training sets or mirrors.

---

## 10. Termination

Any breach of this license **immediately terminates all granted rights**.  
Continued use after termination constitutes willful infringement.

---

## 11. Final Author Statement

“Trust is not given.  
It is oscillated into being — beat-by-beat, wave-by-wave, across the fabric of phase space.”
